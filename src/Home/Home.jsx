                    with react, so it was a very different experience for him, but in fact, he did well on assignment. 
                    Additionally, he also weatify project which shows up weather for 3 days for the given coordinates, name, or 
                    location. He also had static webpage project which was a personal webpage.

              In the steps component, we mentioned that we developed our web based software by following the steps of Extreme Programming, (XP).
              The reason to choose the process model is the development of the software depened on our effective communication, planning the work,
              designing stage which is mainly about coding and its testing. Firstly in communication stage, we organized meetings at the university,
              in online platforms, via social media. In planning phase, we decided that to release it in the dedicated time, each of us should work
              when he had free time. Moreover, we decomposed works like the following. Manaf was required to convert excel file to json file, Main page
              components, its design, and overall contribution to Movie pages. Zaid was required to create json-server, Contact page, its desgin, and
              help Ali in Movie section. Ali was required to test each json-server, Home page, Contact page, its design, and work on Movie page. Fortunately,
              we finished our work on time and test it in terms of verification and validation techniques.
